## Official SAIR Hate Club Website

Welcome to the official repository for the **SAIR Hate Club Website**. This guide will walk you through setting up and running the website locally on your machine.

# Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: You will need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

# Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the website locally:

### 1. Install `http-server`
If you don't already have it, install the `http-server` package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Using your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the project files. You can do this by running the following command (replace <path-to-project> with the actual path to your project directory):

```bash
cd <path-to-project>
```

3. Start the Local Server
Once you're inside the project directory, start the local server by running:

```bash
http-server
```

4. Access the Website
Once the server has started, you should now be able to view the website running locally on your machine.
